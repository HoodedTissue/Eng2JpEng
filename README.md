# Eng2JpEng
Improved code from last time (I think) 

Converts English text into "Japanese English" text (not sure what it's actually called). For Steins;Gate Liner Bound Phenogram and probably some other games that use the same engine

Stormtorch#1128 helped with everything [here](https://github.com/HoodedTissue/Eng2JpEng/blob/main/eng2jpeng.py#L19-L37). Wouldn't have been possible without him (Thank you!!!!)

Ex.
Hello, world[%p] -> Ｈｅｌｌｏ， ｗｏｒｌｄ [%p]

## Usage
Just run eng2jpeng.py in the folder where all of your txt files are and the converted txt files will be in the newly made "converted" folder
Text doesn't show up properly when [] and everything inside is converted into Japanese English but if you for some reason want it to be converted use [this](https://github.com/HoodedTissue/Eng2JpEng/blob/main/Extra/engTWOjpeng.py)
